# JelpKemp

## Description 
This is JelpKemp, somehow-feeling-like Yelp web app. Full-stack, web app, created with MERN stack. 
I tried deploying this app, but it was a huge pain... in the universe. At least that's how it seemed to me. 

Anyways, I had to change my plans and decide to show-case the app quickly using the below GIFs. Watch them in the correct order.
